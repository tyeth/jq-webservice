### Is this service free to use? Will you keep it online? What's it hosted on?

It's eventually going to be load balanced just for fun, but for now it runs on a nearly empty VPS with a good connection, disk, ram, and processing, so in short it should be fine as it is quite a beast along with costing me very little. I'll get notifications of downtime and will fix ASAP.



### Can I use it for commercial reasons:

Sure, knock yourself out. That's the main reason I stuck an API Key in, of DEMO for now, so that you can switch to a new key if and when your use becomes a problem. If you think you've got plans to be a problem, then email me (details on github profile) and I'll sort you out a key in advance.



### What about getting an API Key, or monthly limits?

No limits, but if you end up in a crazy situation then you may get blocked. It's unlikely I'll notice to do that blocking though, so have at it (read point above). Eventually (check back if you ever have errors) I may setup a key system, free still, but to avoid abuse affecting others.



### Got some docs?

Not really... Checkout a rambling story about why this came into fruitition here, which I'm also calling the documentation: https://adafruit-playground.com/u/tyeth/pages/jq-now-as-a-webservice-filtering-large-json-data
